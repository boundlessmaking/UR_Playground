# UR_Playground
 
Simple software that takes svg files with colored paths and converts them to Robot commands.
Meant to be used as an instructional tool for workshops with universal robots. Students can start to experiment directly without learning new software.
SVG files created in illustrator or inkscape are used to control the robot. By specifying an origin coordinate these 2D files can be positioned in space.
